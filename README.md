These are generic image analysis scripts that I have written, collected, 
and otherwise given cobbled-together life to through much trial and error during my time 
at MUSC in the BRIDGE Lab. Versions of these scripts can be found in various studies' 
"STUDY_code" BIDS folders. These are here as a long/reference do the most basic, generic 
forms of these scripts, not modified for any particular study's analysis pipeline.
